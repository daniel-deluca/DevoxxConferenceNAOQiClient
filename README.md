# Welcome to the DevoxxConferenceNAOQiClient Project
This application aims to provide a NAOQi java based client version of Devoxx CFP and Voting Services.

The NAOQi (java SDK) is used to develop application to be run on Aldebaran Robots such as NAO and Pepper.

CFP Application code : https://github.com/nicmarti/cfp-devoxx


## Behaviours
Main behaviours already implemented of the robot are: 

1. Provide current running sessions details

2. Provide current top 5 sessions for the entire conference

3. Watchdog on Conference and current day top session. (When the TOP session changes, the robot says it)

## Future Behaviours:
1. Registration

The robot reads the eTicket and register the participant.
